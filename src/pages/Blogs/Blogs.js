                <p className='text-xl'>Ans: Structured Query language (SQL) pronounced as “S-Q-L” or sometimes as “See-Quel” is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases. A relational database defines relationships in the form of tables. SQL programming can be effectively used to insert, search, update, delete database records. That doesn’t mean SQL cannot do things beyond that. NoSQL is a non-relational DMS, that does not require a fixed schema, avoids joins, and is easy to scale. NoSQL database is used for distributed data stores with humongous data storage needs. NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example companies like Twitter, Facebook, Google that collect terabytes of user data every single day.Traditional RDBMS uses SQL syntax to store and retrieve data for further insights. Instead, a NoSQL database system encompasses a wide range of database technologies that can store structured, semi-structured, unstructured and polymorphic data.</p>

                <p className='text-xl'>jWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties — a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.jwt offers er from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.

                <p className='text-xl'>Ans: Javascript is a simple object-oriented programming language for building interactive HTML pages. JavaScript is also commonly used in the development of games and mobile applications. The program can only be executed and run in an internet browser because it is interpreted as scripting. To run and execute the code outside the browser, we can utilize Node.js. For executing JavaScript on the server, Node.js is a bridge, open-source Js runtime environment. JavaScript code can now execute outside of the browser, thanks to Node.js. Node.js has many components and is primarily used for web development. It may run on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. It provides a cross-platform runtime environment for developing highly scalable server-side JavaScript applications with event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O.

                <h2 className='text-3xl font-semibold mb-5'>Q4: How does Nodejs handle multiple request at the same time?</h2>
                <p >Ans: Given a NodeJS application, since Node is single threaded, say if processing involves a Promise.all that takes 8 seconds, does this mean that the client request that comes after this request would need to wait for eight seconds? No. NodeJS event loop is single threaded. The entire server architecture for NodeJS is not single threaded. Before getting into the Node server architecture, to take a look at typical multithreaded request response model, the web server would have multiple threads and when concurrent requests get to the webserver, the webserver picks threadOne from the threadPool and threadOne processes requestOne and responds to clientOne and when the second request comes in, the web server picks up the second thread from the threadPool and picks up requestTwo and processes it and responds to clientTwo. threadOne is responsible for all kinds of operations that requestOne demanded including doing any blocking IO operations.
